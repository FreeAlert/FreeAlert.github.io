					<h1>Shape the Scroll Ecosystem</h1>
					<p class="align-center">Duration: Sep 2023 - Current | Role: Product design lead/Design manager </p>
				</div>
					<p>At Scroll, besides building a design team from ground up, I am proud of two initiatives. One is the design of Scroll Canvas, a platform for users to build on-chain identities through attestations—driving the highest transaction volume and user growth from a single app in the ecosystem.<br>
                    <p></p>
					I also launched a community-wide sticker contest that let users co-create Scroll’s visual identity, becoming one of the most engaging community activities to date.

					<h3>1. What is Scroll Canvas</h3>	
				</div>
				<div>
				At Scroll, a zk rollup scaling solution for Ethereum, our core mission is to empower developers—not compete with them. As an infrastructure layer, Scroll exists to make building on Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more reliable, while staying true to its foundational values of openness and decentralization.<br>
				<p></p>
				In designing products for Scroll, <strong>we believe in building tools that serve as catalysts for the ecosystem. </strong>One key challenge developers face is building long-term relationships with their users. While they can deploy contracts or ship features, connecting meaningfully with users on-chain remains difficult. <br>
                <p></p>
			    Canvas was born to solve this challenge.
				<p></p>
				Canvas is an attestation service built on the Ethereum Attestation Services (EAS) that allows projects to issue credentials—marking user achievements, celebrating community milestones, or commemorating shared moments. For users, this becomes a way to shape their on-chain persona on Scroll. For developers, it offers a new layer of interaction—projects can both issue and read attestations (“badges”) to offer personalized experiences and deepen engagement.

				</div>
				<div class="section-title center">
					<h3>2. Principles guided experience</h3>	
				</div>
				<div>
					<p></p>
					As Canvas is designed to catalyze meaningful interactions between ecosystem projects and users—not to compete for attention. It’s open and permissionless by default: anyone, whether a user or a developer, can use it or build on top of it freely.
					<p></p>
					Based on the above product defination, I identified three core design guiding principles: Learning by doing, Brand neutral and Growth mindset. 
					<p></p>
					<p><strong>Learning by doing </strong> through seamless onboarding</p>
					<p></p>
					During user testing for Canvas, we found that users didn’t fully understand what a badge is or how it can be minted and displayed in the very beginning. To bridge this gap, we introduced a concrete example: the Ethereum Year Badge. 
					This badge is integrated into the onboarding flow, allowing users to mint it themselves. By doing so, they learn through experience—gaining a clear, hands-on understanding of how badge issuance works for both users and developers.
					<div class="space"> <img src="img/scroll/badge.gif"> </div>
					When designing the Ethereum Year Badge, we infused it with milestones from Ethereum’s journey since its Genesis Block in 2015. Each design element reflects a pivotal chapter in Ethereum’s evolution, including:

The Genesis Block launch, The creation of The DAO, Protocol upgrades like Gray Glacier, Major innovations such as EIP-4844 and Danksharding. The badge celebrates Ethereum's ongoing growth and the vibrant community driving it forward.
					<div class="space"> <img src="img/scroll/levels.png"> </div>
					<p><strong>Brand neutral </strong> through dark mode</p>
					Although Scroll's original brand is beige, we intentionally choose to display Canvas on a dark background with minimal Scroll branding. This ensures that users’ own personas—and the badges they’ve earned—are the visual focus. For developers, this also means they can shape their own branded experience within the Canvas framework.
					You can see the diverse range of badges our ecosystem developers have created for their protocols.
					<div class="space"> <img src="img/scroll/badges.jpg"> </div>
					<p><strong>Built-in growth mindset</strong> through rewarding invites </p>
					We believed users would love Canvas—and we designed for that momentum. Referral is part of the first experience, giving both the inviter and invitee real on-chain rewards. What’s special is that this viral growth was fueled entirely by the product’s design and user-driven incentives—Scroll didn’t spend a cent on user acquisition. Growth spread like wildfire.
				    <div class="space"> <img src="img/scroll/Invite.png"> </div>
				</div>
				<div class="section-title center">
					<h3>3. Impact</h3>	
				</div>
				<div>
					We broke EAS’s service on our launch day due to overwhelming demand. Since then, Scroll has remained the No.1 chain on EAS, with more attestations than Base, Optimism, Linea, and Arbitrum combined. You can check out the result <a href="https://dune.com/ryanyyi/eas"> <u>at dune</u></a> 
					<img src="img/scroll/impact.png">
					Unfortunately, Scroll's co-founders decided to shut it down due to indiscriminate backlash after the token launch. 
					<p></p>
					Despite everything, I remain confident in the value of Canvas. I truly believe it's the most groundbreaking product Scroll has ever created.

					<h2>#Design with community</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p></p>
					<strong> The challenge:</strong> We wanted to create a character to represent Scroll and strengthen our brand identity—but we weren’t sure what would truly resonate with our web3 community.<br>

<strong>The idea: </strong> I launched a sticker contest inviting participants to design a unique character and submit two stickers:

One featuring “Rock & scRoll” and One based on any Scroll-related meme of their choice. <br>
<strong>The prize: </strong> Winners were selected by the community on Discord. The top winner received $1,000, and four runners-up received $200 each. <br>
<Strong>My role: </Strong> I planned and managed the entire Sticker Contest project, including all design, communication, and coordination efforts. <br>
<Strong>Impact: </Strong> The contest became one of Scroll’s most engaging community events, with over 200 submissions and 900+ likes on the top entries. It not only surfaced new creative talent but also helped co-create our evolving brand identity. <br>

							Design at Scroll is different.
It’s not just about building products to attract and retain users anymore. As a chain, Scroll relies on others to build on top of it. That changes the role of design—from crafting standalone experiences to creating a platform that inspires others to build and design with us. It’s about scaling through community—and I’m continuously learning through the process.
